# Error oblivious programming

Is a programming technique where the programmer can write his code without taking into consideration of errors. It is sometimes also known as workflow management but that concept often seems to include support for business process modelling and the use of languages such as BPMN for descriping the process.

## Libraries

- [Cadence](https://cadenceworkflow.io) a software solution from Uber support Java and Golang
- [Temporal](https://www.temporal.io) built by the Cadence team but as its own company.
- Apache Airflow might also count but it is only suitable for Data science pipelines.
